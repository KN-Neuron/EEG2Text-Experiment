BrainAccess EEG headsets
========================

BrainAccess headsets require manual installation of the SDK, which can be downloaded from the `BrainAccess website <https://www.brainaccess.ai/download/>`_. The version of the SDK depends on used device.

For the instructions on how to install the SDK, please refer to the `BrainAccess documentation <https://www.brainaccess.ai/documentation/python-api/>`_.

To use the SDK on Windows, you also need to copy the DLL libraries from the main folder of the SDK (see screenshot below) to the main folder of your application (from which you run the application).
